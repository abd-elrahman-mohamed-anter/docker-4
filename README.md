# DevOps Project: Docker & Container Orchestration

This project demonstrates the use of Docker Compose to manage and scale a multi-container application.

## Prerequisites
- Docker  
- Docker Compose  

---

## 1. Initial Deployment & Container Status
The first step involved running the Docker Compose setup. Despite a warning about a missing Dockerfile, the command successfully started the database container (`clinic-db`) and the application container (`spring-bit-clinic`).

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## 2. Verifying the Running Containers
To check the status of all containers managed by the Docker Compose file, the following command was used:

```bash
docker compose ps
```
Purpose:

Confirms that both the database and application containers are running correctly.

Useful to verify if containers started without errors or if any crashed during initialization.

üì∏ Example output:

---

## 3. Accessing the Application
The application was accessed successfully in a web browser. The URL `localhost:32775` indicated that the application was running, showing the "Welcome" page of the Spring PetClinic application.

Purpose:

Ensures the application is reachable from your host machine.

The Spring PetClinic ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù page confirms the application is properly connected to the database and running.

# Scaling Spring PetClinic with Docker Compose & Nginx Load Balancer üê≥

## 4. Scaling the Spring Application

To scale the application into multiple replicas, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-replica.yml up -d --scale spring-app=5
```

* `docker compose` ‚Üí Starts Docker Compose (v2).
* `-f docker-compose-replica.yml` ‚Üí Use the replica-specific compose file.
* `up -d` ‚Üí Launch containers in detached (background) mode.
* `--scale spring-app=5` ‚Üí Run **5 instances** of the Spring PetClinic application.
Benefits:

Handles higher traffic efficiently.

Provides redundancy: if one container fails, others continue serving requests.

Demonstrates horizontal scaling in action.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Docker may warn that `version:` in the Compose file is obsolete ‚Äî you can safely remove it.

## 5. Verifying Running Containers

Check which containers are running with:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

This lists:

* **db** ‚Üí 1 MySQL container.
* **spring-app** ‚Üí 5 replicas (`spring-app-1` ‚Ä¶ `spring-app-5`).
* **nginx** ‚Üí A single reverse proxy instance.

Nginx was configured to distribute traffic across multiple Spring replicas:

upstream spring_backend {
    server spring-app:8080;
}

server {
    listen 8080;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://spring_backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        add_header X-Served-By $upstream_addr;
    }
}


Purpose:

upstream spring_backend ‚Üí Defines the pool of Spring replicas.

proxy_pass http://spring_backend ‚Üí Routes incoming requests to the upstream pool.

X-Served-By ‚Üí Custom header to identify which replica handled the request.

Allows monitoring load distribution and helps debug traffic routing issues.

7. Testing Load Balancing

Run the following command to simulate multiple requests and observe load balancing:


for i in {1..30}; do curl -s -i http://localhost:8888 | grep X-Served-By; done


Explanation:

for i in {1..30} ‚Üí Sends 30 consecutive requests.
```bash
curl -s -i http://localhost:8888 ‚Üí Queries the Nginx reverse proxy.
```

grep X-Served-By ‚Üí Filters out only the header showing which replica responded.

Observation:

Each request is handled by a different Spring replica, as shown by varying IPs in X-Served-By.

Confirms Nginx is effectively balancing the load across multiple instances.

üì∏ Example output:
![curl-loop](for.png)

üëâ The responses show different container IPs like:

```
X-Served-By: 172.23.0.3:8080
X-Served-By: 172.23.0.4:8080
X-Served-By: 172.23.0.5:8080
X-Served-By: 172.23.0.6:8080
```

This confirms that Nginx **distributes traffic across multiple replicas**.

---

## 7. Final Result

* ‚úÖ **5 Spring PetClinic replicas** running in parallel.
* ‚úÖ **Nginx reverse proxy** load balances incoming traffic.
* ‚úÖ **X-Served-By header** makes it easy to see which replica processed each request.
